# Migrate to Volto

See the chapter {ref}`plone6docs:backend-migrate-to-volto-label` of the Plone Upgrade Guide.

This explains mostly why you need to do what and how to use the form `@@migrate_to_volto` by hand.

You can (and should) use the power of that feature in your exportimport-based migration as described in https://github.com/collective/collective.exportimport#migrate-to-volto
